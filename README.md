project 1
Implement the greedy algorithms for Interval Scheduling and Interval Partitioning using heapsort and priority
queue. Both algorithms require sorting, which should be done through heapsort (implement the heapsort algorithm
yourself shown on PPT slide 60 of Chapter 2 Basics of Algorithm Analysis), and priority queue should be used
to improve the efficiency of the greedy algorithm for Interval Partitioning (PPT slide 29 of Chapter 4 Greedy
Algorithms). Also, your program should randomly generate n intervals within time range [sTime;eTime], these
three parameters should be received from keyboard. For example, user may want to randomly generate 10 intervals
within the time range [5;30], then we know n = 10, sTime = 5 and eTime = 30.
